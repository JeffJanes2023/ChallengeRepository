    <p>My Name is Jeff Janes. I reside in the wonderful state of California. I have lived for a few decades but I was actually born in Benson, Minnesota land of 10000 lakes and the home of the Minnesota Vikings. I moved between Minnesota and California many time, in my youth, due to my parents changing jobs. Each state has its plus's and minus's but I like them both. I have a Bachlors Degree I got from University of Phoenix and been working in the IT industry for many years</p>
